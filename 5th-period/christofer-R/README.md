## Christofer R — AP Computer Science Portfolio


## About Me:

Hello! My name is Christofer, and I’m a junior at Mt. Eden High School. I consider myself a mediocre student who does okay. Overall,some subjects I enjoy, some I don’t mind, and others I dislike. This year in AP Computer Science, I’ve learned the fundamentals of C++, JavaScript, how the internet works, and basic coding principles. Working with peers on projects has been a great experience.
At first, C++ was confusing and difficult for me to grasp, especially since tech classes were new territory for me. However, this class has helped me understand coding basics, even though some subjects don’t naturally capture my attention. Taking this course opened my eyes to programming, and now I’m excited to possibly apply what I’ve learned in the future.


## About This Project:

This portfolio is my final project for AP Computer Science. Unlike a traditional paper portfolio, this website hosts the coding projects I completed throughout the school year. Each project was created with a fair amount of creative freedom, which allowed se to come up with some really cool ideas. This website serves as a collection where I can reflect on my work and showcase the progress I made in computer science.


## Portfolio Overview:

An About Me section introducing who I am.


A Navigation Bar for easy access to different areas of the site.


Three JavaScript projects I created (some in collaboration) using CodePen.



## Featured Projects:

Stopwatch App
A functional stopwatch you can use to time anything with precision.
Matching Game
A fun memory game where you flip cards to find matching pairs — great for when you’re bored!
Connect 4
The classic Connect 4 game with a twist since tokens don’t fall all the way to the bottom. Better have a good strategy.
